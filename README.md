### This is a project from Codecademy's full-stack engineer course
***
The idea of this project is to **mitigate** common attacks on web applications, hence, the base code was provided by codecademy and my job was to apply some strategies to avoid attacks

The packages used in this project were:

- express-session
- express-validator
- helmet
- csurf
- cookie-parser
- prepared statements with placeholders
